Question-2: Habit Tracker
Build a simple backend for a Habit Tracker app.
Backend (Node.js)
● POST /auth/signup and POST /auth/login
● GET /habits – List habits for current user
● POST /habits – Create a habit
● POST /habits/:id/complete – Mark as done for today
● GET /habits/:id/status?date=YYYY-MM-DD – Is this habit completed on a given day?
